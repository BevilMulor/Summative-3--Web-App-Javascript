Welcome to the final summative project of the Advanced Front-End module. Building upon the previous assignment where you utilized Bootstrap to implement a web mockup, this summative assignment aims further to enhance the functionality and interactivity of your web applications. In this assignment, you will incorporate JavaScript, jQuery, cookies, and local storage features to add dynamic elements and improve user experience. 

Instructions

Review Previous Work: Revisit the web mockup created in the previous assignment and ensure that the design and layout closely match the submitted mockup.
Integrate JavaScript and jQuery
Utilize JavaScript to add interactive elements to your web application.
Implement jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.
Creatively Enhance user interactions (such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and animations).
Implement Cookies
Integrate cookies to store and retrieve user preferences or session data.
Utilize cookies for features such as remembering user settings, language preferences, or customizations (themes, etc..).
Incorporate Local Storage:
Implement local storage to store temporary or persistent data on the client side.
Utilize local storage for features like saving user-generated content, caching data for offline use, etc...
Testing and Debugging
Thoroughly test the functionality of your web application across different browsers and devices.
Debug any errors or issues encountered during testing to ensure smooth user experience.
Documentation
Provide clear documentation detailing the enhancements made to the original web mockup.
Include instructions for users on how to utilize the new features implemented.
Submission Guidelines

GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository to host your enhanced web application and ensure the repository is well-organized with clear folder structures and documentation.
Code Quality:
Maintain clean and well-commented code following best practices for JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
Ensure consistency in coding style across all team members' contributions
Group Collaboration
All team members must actively contribute to developing and improving the web application.
Collaborate effectively using version control tools and communication platforms.
